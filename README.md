# lasteroids

An asteroids-like game written in love2d

## Overview

Built as an experiment in learning lua, this is a fairly basic Asteroids clone.

## How to run it

Lasteroids uses the [love2d](https://love2d.org/) engine, so you'll likely want to download that and run it using this directory as input.  (Or you can grab an executable from the release pages, but the value of this repo is likely more in the code examples for people learning love2d and lovetoys than actually playing the game...)

## Built With
* The [love2d](https://love2d.org/) framework
* [lovetoys](https://github.com/lovetoys/lovetoys) - for ECS
* [HC](https://hc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - for banging rocks together (collision detection)
* [baton](https://github.com/tesselode/baton) - neeed inpuuut!
* [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) - vectors and gamestate
* [Binocles](https://github.com/maromaroXD/Binocles) - debugging, for when you're feeling introspective
* [Hyperspace](https://www.pixelsagas.com/?download=hyperspace) - an awesome font from Pixel Sagas
* [boon](https://github.com/camchenry/boon) - for builds

## Thanks To

* Atari, for the [original Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), the first game I remember playing in an arcade.
* [retrogamedeconstructionzone.com](http://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com/2019/10/asteroids-by-numbers.html), for an article with some useful numbers
* Mom and Dad, for all those quarters.
